# Session 1: Getting Started, Strings, Numbers

## Overview

For folks who have a busy job who are trying to "level up" on the side

Assumptions
- Adventurous Beginner: comfortable not knowing, playing around, figuring stuff out
- Reasonably comfortable slicing and dicing data using Excel / Google Sheets
- You probably aren't going to be working full time as a coder. May use scripts you've written every week, but you don't have time to write/modify scripts more often than every couple months -- so you can't count on being fluent when you need to crank out a script

## Before the Session

The students should download and install:
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/): that gives you Python, pandas, notebooks
- [GitHub Desktop]( https://desktop.github.com/): for backing up your stuff, being able to undo your mistakes, and collaborate with other people
- [Visual Studio Code]( https://code.visualstudio.com/): one of the tools will use for editing and running Python

Also create an account on [GitHub]( https://github.com/)


## Using GitHub and GitHub Desktop

- GitHub will save your ass. And while you can use it directly in most tools, at the beginning it's easiest to just do it using GitHub Desktop.
- Lots of bells and whistles in GitHub, especially when people are collaborating. We are going to start with the most simple, easy to use stuff that will save your butt

1) On the web, go to your GitHub account, create a repo
- Both your expository for our sessions and building up your own mini reference library / knowledge base, which is critical for being effective when you aren't a full-time coder
- Minimal set up: gitignore for Python, Readme, license (MIT?)

2) Start up GitHub Desktop
- Login for the first time
- Clone your repo


3) Create the following
- Click the button for Windows Explorer, then create 4 folders: python-basics, methods-modules, libraries-excel, pandas
- Click the button for Visual Studio Code, and Create
- Links.md: to keep track of any links you find along the way
- Create a notes.md in python-basics
- Switch back to Windows Explorer, then copy notes.md into each of the folders, so you got a place for notes

4) Sync your repo, and check it out online!


## Python Basics: Strings and Numbers

Strings
- In Visual Studio Code, open the Python-basics folder, open notes.md, and create strings.py
- print my name is___ and I am a kitty/puppy pirate
  - NOTE: Python 3 vs Python 2 -- print vs print(
- create 3 variables: name, pronouns, occupation
- print one of them, 3 of them, 3 strung together using + 
- f'
- Sync your repo, and check it out online

Numbers
- create numbers.py
- how much cream you need per month
- basic math, e.g., cream per year, cream per voyage depending on length of voyage
- error messages
- Sync your repo, and check it out online

if then else

 ## Homework

- You've Learned about Addition and Multiplication, now go Google to get division, subtraction (or WC3)
- If feeling adventurous: go learn a bit more about string functions, including for creating uppercase, Join, strip
