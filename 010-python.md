# Session 1

## Overview

For folks who have a busy job who are trying to "level up" on the side

Assumptions
- Adventurous Beginner: comfortable not knowing, playing around, figuring stuff out
- Reasonably comfortable slicing and dicing data using Excel / Google Sheets
- You probably aren't going to be working full time as a coder. May use scripts you've written every week, but you don't have time to write/modify scripts more often than every couple months -- so you can't count on being fluent when you need to crank out a script

## Before the Session

The students should download and install:
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/): that gives you Python, pandas, notebooks
- [GitHub Desktop]( https://desktop.github.com/): for backing up your stuff, being able to undo your mistakes, and collaborate with other people
- [Visual Studio Code]( https://code.visualstudio.com/): one of the tools will use for editing and running Python

Also create an account on [GitHub]( https://github.com/)


## Using GitHub and GitHub Desktop

- GitHub will save your ass. And while you can use it directly in most tools, at the beginning it's easiest to just do it using GitHub Desktop.
- Lots of bells and whistles in GitHub, especially when people are collaborating. We are going to start with the most simple, easy to use stuff that will save your butt

1) On the web, go to your GitHub account, create a repo
- Both your expository for our sessions and building up your own mini reference library / knowledge base, which is critical for being effective when you aren't a full-time coder
- Minimal set up: gitignore for Python, Readme, license (MIT?)

2) Start up GitHub Desktop
- Login for the first time
- Clone your repo


3) Create the following
- Click the button for Windows Explorer, then create 4 folders: python-basics, methods-modules, libraries-excel, pandas
- Click the button for Visual Studio Code, and Create
- Links.md: to keep track of any links you find along the way
- Create a notes.md in python-basics
- Switch back to Windows Explorer, then copy notes.md into each of the folders, so you got a place for notes

4) Sync your repo, and check it out online!


## Python Basics

Strings
- In Visual Studio Code, open the Python-basics folder, open notes.md, and create strings.py
- print my name is___ and I am a kitty/puppy pirate
  - NOTE: Python 3 vs Python 2 -- print vs print(
- create 3 variables: name, pronouns, occupation
- print one of them, 3 of them, 3 strung together using + 
- f'
- Sync your repo, and check it out online

Numbers
- create numbers.py
- how much cream you need per month
- basic math, e.g., cream per year, cream per voyage depending on length of voyage
- error messages
- Sync your repo, and check it out online

Arrays (arrays.py)
- your crew's names
- Working with individual members of array
- Storing cream per person in an array
- Sync your repo, and check it out online

Loops (loops.py)
- print the names of your crew, then names and amount of cream
- using in vs traditional for loop
- How much cream: we want to generate data we can work with
- Time for Your Google: Python Random Number
- Loop through and create {} with name, amount of cream

# Methods and Modules

Methods (methods.py)
- why methods
- put into method as is
- my approach: tiny little baby steps: make a very small change, re-run it, make another small change: catch errors right away, less overwhelming (use comments to draft a short plan, then fill out actual code)
- new version: given list of names, return array of cream consumption per month for 5 months
- Sync your repo!
- New version: given list of names, items and categories, number of months, return: Month, name, category, what, amount

Modules (modules.py)
- Turn into make_data



## Libraries (libraries-excel.py)

Explore the library, play around a little bit with individual cells

Loops through to create spreadsheet given the data you made
- Try a Conditional formatting, play with colors 

Create a chart, such as a line chart?

One Excel file with all the data, for pandas lessons

One Excel per Kitty pirate (because they are such divas)
