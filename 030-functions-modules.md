# Session 3: Modules, pandas


## Functions and Modules

Functions (functions.py)
- why functions
- my approach: tiny little voyage steps: make a very small change, re-run it, make another small change: catch errors right away, less overwhelming (use comments to draft a short plan, then fill out actual code)
- new version: given list of names, return array of cream consumption per month for 5 months
- Sync your repo!
- New version: same thing, only we are going to save it to Excel
- New version: given list of names, items and categories, number of months, return: Month, name, category, what, amount
Other things to know about functions:

1) Return

2) default parameters:  get_data(country = “PuppyLand”)
